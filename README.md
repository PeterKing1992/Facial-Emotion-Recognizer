# Facial-Emotion-Recognizer
- A residual network that recognizes people's expressions by looking at 48x48 pixels photos of their faces. 
- If you wish to test this with your own photo, please store your photo in a grayscale 48x48 pixels png file in the same directory as "Emotion_Prediction_2.py" and name it 
"Face.png". 
- "Emotion_Prediction_2.py" contains the main code, when you run it, it will try to categorize the facial expression in "Face.png" into one of the 7 categories: 'Angry', 
'Disgust', 'Fear', 'Happy', 'Neutral', 'Sad', 'Surprised'. 
- The fer2013 folder contains the dataset I used to train and test the model. 
- Libraries required to run the code: PyTorch, Python Image Library.
